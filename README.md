# ViewFactory
View Factory is the easy way to create an interface for an app. Choose the views you would like from the list of selections and swipe left to see how they would be interacted with on screen. When you are done click the white button in the top right to have the corresponding code emailed to you. Copy and paste that code in the ViewController class of your XCode project and you will have a working template app with easy to change, stylistic parameters.
## What's next 
-[ ] Update code to swift 4. This will allow for multi-line strings. replace filler code strings in each element class with the correct code.
-[ ] Test email ability on a device.
-[ ] More precise ratios in the menu1 class will bring better quality on bigger screens.
-[ ] Add compatability for elements within the menu1 class (wait for completion of this before finalizing the code to be emailed to the user)
